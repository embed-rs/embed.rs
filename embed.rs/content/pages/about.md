# About this site

[embed.rs](http://embed.rs) is a combined effort to collect useful articles and know-how about the budding ecosystem around embedded development using [Rust](https://rust-lang.org). We believe the latter to be a good fit for the challenges of embedded development, especially with regards to security and safety criteria.

This site is also the home of the crates that are part of the [embed-rs](https://github.com/embed-rs) project, which aims at providing a good bottom-up foundation for embedded development.

If you want to contribute code, an article or know-how to embed.rs, feel free to [contact us](mailto:epost@marcbrinkmann.de).
